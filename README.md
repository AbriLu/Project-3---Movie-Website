# Project-3---Movie-Website
This is a web development project where I build a movie website using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, RestAPI and MongoDB.
I am particularly captivated by Node.js and RestAPI implementations, as it will be my first time dealing with APIs and web frameworks. 
Once I am able to fully implement this project, I will be much more comfortable learning other major web development frameworks
and deploy more sophisticated and secure websites (or dashboards).
This project is important to me as I would like in the future to be able to display the results of my research or machine learning projects/applications
on well-presented web dashboards or web pages over which I have full control.
